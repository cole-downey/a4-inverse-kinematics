# Animation P4 - Inverse Kinematics

In this project, I implemented an inverse kinematics controlled chain. I used Gradient Descent with Backtracking Line Search and Newton's Method to iterate towards an optimized solution, with the target being the user's mouse. In this demo the chain has 4 links, but my project supports any number of links. Written in C++ using OpenGL.

To use after build:
./A4 ../resources N_LINKS
